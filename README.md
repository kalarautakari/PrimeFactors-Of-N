# PrimeFactors-Of-N
A way to check all the prime factors of N, approximately safe for N &lt;= 10^18.

The program only runs the loop until $\sqrt{n}$, making it essentially safe for big numbers (larger than 10^8).

The output format is:
p1^a1 x p2^a2 x ... x pk^ak

Just input any number, and the program will do it for you.
